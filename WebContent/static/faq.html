  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
  <div id="toc"></div>
  <dl>
    <dt>What is this site?</dt>
    <dd>This is a file-sharing site, accessible via a web browser
      as well as a WebDAV client.</dd>

    <dt>What is the purpose of this site?</dt>
    <dd>
      This site enables Marakana instructors and students to share files
      with each other. <br /> Generally, instructors publish class
      materials to students while students have the option of sharing
      their work in order to solicit feedback.
    </dd>

    <dt>What is the correct URL to access this site?</dt>
    <dd>
      The base URL for a class with a specific
      <code>&lt;id&gt;</code>
      must be in the following format:<br />
      <code>https://class-&lt;id&gt;.marakana.com/class/&lt;id&gt;/files/</code>
      <br /> <span class="note">Note that the URL given to you
        was most likely shortened - e.g. <code>http://mrkn.co/s0tur1</code>.
      </span>
    </dd>

    <dt>Who gets access to this site?</dt>
    <dd>
      This site is accessible to the registered students and the
      instructor teaching the class. <br /> The class must be confirmed
      for this site to be active.<br /> <span class="note">The
        site is also accessible to Marakana staff - for maintenance
        reasons.</span>
    </dd>

    <dt>How do I register for this class, so that I can access this
      site?</dt>
    <dd>
      For public classes, you can register via our <a
        href="http://marakana.com/training/schedule.html">public
        schedule page</a>.<br /> For private (on-site) classes, you can
      register using a special URL/code that is generally provided to
      you by our training coordinator, your training manager, or the
      instructor.<br /> <span class="note"> Note that your
        employer may also require that you register through your
        organization's own learning management system - separate from
        ours. </span>
    </dd>

    <dt>How do I log in to this site?</dt>
    <dd>
      To access this site, you need to log in with the same credentials
      you use to access Marakana.com site. Your username is your email
      address.<br /> The login dialog will vary based on the
      browser/client you are using, but on the protocol level, you'll be
      using <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">Basic
        access authentication</a>.<br /> <span class="note">Our use
        of HTTPS (SSL/TLS) protects the confidentiality of your
        credentials as they are transmitted over the network.</span>
    </dd>

    <dt>I forgot my password. What do I do?</dt>
    <dd>
      You can <a href="https://marakana.com/reset_password.html">reset
        your password</a> via our site. You will need access to your email
      for this to work.
    </dd>

    <dt>How do I log out of this site?</dt>
    <dd>
      With the Basic access authentication, the client typically caches
      your username/password and sends them on every request. This means
      that it is up to the client to "forget" your credentials in order
      to log you out.<br />
      <ul>
        <li>For browsers, this often means that you have to either
          close the browser or use some other mechanism (that is
          browser-specific) to clear current authenticated sessions.</li>
        <li>For WebDAV clients, you can "log out" by
          unmounting/ejecting the shared volume. How this is done is
          client-specific.</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>I have access to multiple classes. Why do I have to log in
      to each one separately?</dt>
    <dd>For security reasons, each class is accessible under a
      unique domain name. Your credentials are domain-specific as far as
      your browser/client is concerned.</dd>

    <dt>How long will I have access to this site?</dt>
    <dd>You will retain access to this site for as long as you
      maintain an active account on Marakana.com.</dd>
